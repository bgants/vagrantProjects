you need to grab the spark binary its too big to include, sop downlod it:
http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html


The python program that runs the spark context uses a down load of a file from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database

There is no reason why you can modify this to use another file but wanted to use a large file for testing this is also way 
too big to upload to git.
